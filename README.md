📌 Executive Summary – E-Commerce Business Performance Analysis
🔍 Objective

To analyze sales performance, customer behavior, retention patterns, and operational efficiency using real e-commerce transaction data, and provide actionable recommendations to improve revenue growth, customer retention, and customer experience.

📊 Key Findings & Insights
1️⃣ Revenue Growth & Seasonality

The business experienced rapid revenue growth throughout 2017, with peak performance in November 2017, followed by stable high revenue levels in 2018.

Clear seasonal patterns are observed, particularly during Q4, likely driven by promotional events and festive demand.

Impact: Indicates successful scaling and strong seasonal demand drivers.

2️⃣ Product Category Performance

Revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of categories.

Beauty & Health, Watches & Gifts, and Home & Lifestyle products are the top revenue contributors.

These categories consistently outperform others in total sales value.

Impact: Category focus plays a major role in overall revenue performance.

3️⃣ Customer Retention Challenge

The majority of customers are one-time buyers, indicating low repeat purchase behavior.

This suggests a strong acquisition funnel but weak post-purchase engagement and retention strategy.

Impact: Long-term revenue growth is at risk due to low customer lifetime value across most customers.

4️⃣ Delivery Performance & Customer Satisfaction

On-time deliveries receive a high average review score (4.29).

Late deliveries result in a significantly lower average review score (2.57).

Delivery delays have a direct and severe negative impact on customer satisfaction.

Impact: Operational inefficiencies directly affect brand perception and customer loyalty.

5️⃣ High-Value Customers (CLV Analysis)

A small segment of customers contributes disproportionately high lifetime revenue.

The top customers generate multiple times more revenue than the average customer.

Impact: Retaining high-value customers is critical for revenue stability.

🎯 Strategic Business Recommendations
✅ Revenue & Growth

Increase marketing and inventory investment during high-performing periods (Q4) to maximize seasonal revenue.

Monitor mid-year performance trends to proactively address potential slowdowns.

Use these categories for bundling and cross-selling to improve average order value.

Post-purchase engagement campaigns

Target one-time buyers with re-engagement initiatives to increase repeat purchases.
